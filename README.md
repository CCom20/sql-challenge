# Employee Analysis
This project looks at employee data, including date of hire and salaries, through the use of a SQL database. There is an ERD provided for reference concerning primary and foreign keys.

## Creating Tables
Table creation is straight-forward, and it follows dependancies. In order: 
1. Departments
2. Titles
3. Employees
4. Department Employee
5. Department Manager
6. Salaries
This order was followed so that the code could run without specific selections in order to create the tables. It also made it easier to import the data knowing the order of creation and dependancies.
